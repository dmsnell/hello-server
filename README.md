# Hello

This runs a primitive `express`-based server on port `3245`
and all it does is send `hello` on `GET` requests.

## Usage

Start the server by cloning this repository and running
the normal `npm` install and startup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmsnell/hello-server.git
cd hello-server
npm install
node index.js
```

Verify that it's working by poking it from the console.

```bash
curl localhost:3245
```
